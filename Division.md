Let $a \not = 0, b$ are integers
- if there is an integer $c$ such that $b = ac$, then we say a **divides** b
	- a is a factor of b
	- b is a multiple of a
	- $a \mid b$
	- $a \not \mid b$
- If remainder is 0, then $a \mid b$
- if $a | b$ and $a | c$, then $a | (b + c)$
- if $a | b$ then $a | bc$ for all int $c$
- if $a | b$ and $b | c$ then $a | c$

"Assume $a \mid b$. Then by def. divides $\exists m \in \mathbb{Z}$ s.t. $b = am$"

## Division Algorithm
"Not an algorithm"
The Division Algorithm: Suppose a is an integer and d is a positive integer. There are unique integers q and r, with 0 â‰¤ r < d, such that a=dq+r
- d is the divisor
- a is the dividend
- q is the quotient
- r is the remainder

Note the following:
- q = a div d is used to express the quotient
- r = a mod d is used to express the remainder.
