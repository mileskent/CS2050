If
1. Fixed number of trials
2. Each trial is independent
3. There is a binary outcome
$$
P(B(n, p) = k) = C(n,k) \cdot p^k \cdot (1 - p)^{n - k}
$$
where
- $P(B(n, p) = k)$ is the probability that given $n$ trials, $k$ successes will be achieved
- k = # of "successes"
- $p$ = probability of a "success" on a single attempt
- $n$ = # of trials
