	- Permutations with repetition
		- $n^r$ = the number r-permutations of a set of n objects
	- Combination with repetition
		- Stars and bars
			- When choosing r elements from n objects and unlimited repetition is allowed, you can find the number of possibilities using C(n+r-1,r)
			- or C(stars + bars, stars)
	- Counting Indistinguishable Objects:
		- See Day 24 Slides on counting indistinguishable objects
			- E.g. Reordering  the letters in “SUCCESS”
			- How many strings of length ten can be formed using three 0’s, four 1’s, three 2’s.
- 7.1
	- Know what an experiment, sample space, and an event is
	- Know how to calculate the probability of an event E
	- Know how to calculate the probability of the complement of an event. 
	- Know how to calculate the probability of the union of two events.
	- Many of these types of questions require you to be competent with counting from unit 7.
