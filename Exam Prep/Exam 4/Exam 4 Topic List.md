- 6.1
	- Know how to do any counting problem discussed in 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5
		- Tree diagrams

		- [[Product Rule]]
		- [[Sum Rule]]
		- Division Rule
			- Dividing elimates events
			- e.g transforming nPr to nCr
		- Subtraction Rule
			- Just use [[Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion]]
- 6.2
	- Pigeonhole Principle
	- Generalized Pigeonhole Principle
	- Similar problems to pigeonhole
	- proofs with pigeonhole
- 6.3
	- Permutations
		- Order matters
		- Know the formulas
		- Know when to use it
	- Combinations
		- Order doesn’t matter
		- Know the formula
		- Know that C(n,r) = C(n,n-r)
		- Know when to use them
- 6.5
	- Permutations with repetition
		- $n^r$ = the number r-permutations of a set of n objects
	- Combination with repetition
		- Stars and bars
			- When choosing r elements from n objects and unlimited repetition is allowed, you can find the number of possibilities using C(n+r-1,r)
			- or C(stars + bars, stars)
	- Counting Indistinguishable Objects:
		- See Day 24 Slides on counting indistinguishable objects
			- E.g. Reordering  the letters in “SUCCESS”
			- How many strings of length ten can be formed using three 0’s, four 1’s, three 2’s.
			- These are all [[Banana Problem]]
- 7.1
	- Know what an experiment, sample space, and an event is
		- **An experiment is a procedure that yields one of a given set of possible outcomes.**  
			- Circumstances X when finding P(X)
		- The sample space of the experiment is the set of possible outcomes  
		- An event is a subset of the sample space
	- Know how to calculate the probability of an event E
	- Know how to calculate the probability of the complement of an event. 
	- Know how to calculate the probability of the union of two events.
	- Many of these types of questions require you to be competent with counting from unit 7.
